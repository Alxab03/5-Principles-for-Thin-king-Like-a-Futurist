# 5-Principles-for-Thin-king-Like-a-Futurist
1.Forget about Predictions.
If somebody tells you they can predict the future, don’t believe them.
Nobody can predict large sociotechnical transformations and what
exactly these are going to look like.
We are getting better at making point
predictions. There are prediction markets
and all kinds of data-rich tools with which we’re trying to predict elections, market share prices, and the success of product introductions. All of these focus on one particular event, a
particular point. But a lot of our work at the Institute for the
Future is focused on comprehending big, complex transformations—rather than just one thing, one event. We’re looking
at the interconnection between technologies and society and
economics and organizations.

2 Focus on Signals.
What tools do we have to help us systematically think about the future
and develop foresight? There is no
data about the future; all the data we
have is about the past. Historical data
is useful when things continue as they
are. You can just continue planning for the
same trajectory. That’s fairly easy.

3. Look Back to See Forward.
I said earlier that there is no data about the
future; the only data we have is about the past.
While we cannot fully rely on past data to help
us see the future, there are larger patterns in history that we tend to repeat over and over again.
Thus, we need to look back to see forward. I’ve
started to think of myself as a historian as much as a
futurist. I’m trying to understand the larger story and to place what is happening today and what we see on the horizon into a larger context. We don’t
repeat our history completely, but we do repeat patterns. If we look at the
invention of the printing press and the debates and worries that people
had at that time, we see that those concerns are very similar to our current
debates and worries about fake news, computational propaganda, bots and how they skew our public opinion.1
 It’s almost eerie. People were talking about fake information and propaganda and lies
all those years ago!

4. Uncover Patterns.
Ultimately, the goal of aggregating signals and connecting these to the larger historical context helps us understand patterns of change—the deeper tides I mentioned earlier. It helps us understand how we got to key developments shaping our future. What is the larger story? What are the tides of change? At the Institute for the Future, we’ve been working doing things is emerging: a nascent curve. We’re in the early stages—we’re just now seeing signals of it—but this curve tells us something about a new way of doing things.

5. Create a Community.
Being a futurist or thinking about the future is not a solitary affair. I have a lot of distrust for people who say: “I’m a futurist. I went to a mountaintop, and I saw this vision, and this is your future.”
